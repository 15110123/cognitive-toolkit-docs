# Tutorials

There are tutorials for Python users and for BrainScript users.

## Python Jupyter Notebook Tutorials

CNTK Python Jupyter notebook [tutorials](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/cognitive-toolkit/tutorials) cover a range of different application including image classification, language understanding, reinforcement learning and others. 

You can also try out the tutorials live with [Azure Notebooks](https://notebooks.azure.com/cntk/libraries/tutorials).

Additional Python tutorials:
* The folder [Tutorials/NumpyInterop](https://github.com/Microsoft/CNTK/tree/master/Tutorials/NumpyInterop) contains a simple example of how to use numpy arrays as input for CNTK training and evaluation.
* ['Build your own image classifier using Transfer Learning'](./Build-your-own-image-classifier-using-Transfer-Learning.md) provides two examples for custom image classifiers using transfer learning.

## BrainScript Tutorials
* [Getting Started](./Tutorial/Tutorial.md): Simple Logistic Regression and multi-class classification
* [Image Recognition](./Hands-On-Labs-Image-Recognition.md): Image recognition on CIFAR-10 with Convolutional and Residual Networks
* [Language Understanding with ATIS](./Hands-On-Labs-Language-Understanding.md): Slot tagging and intent classification with Recurrent Networks
* [Object Detection using Fast R-CNN](./Object-Detection-using-Fast-R-CNN.md): Object detection in images using the Fast R-CNN algorithm
