# Presentations

Here you can find CNTK and Deep Learning related presentations:

* Sayan Pathak **Cognitive Toolkit (CNTK) Deep Dive and Hands-on Tutorial - Nov 2016** This [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pl-kbFJ1KzU) goes from a high level view, to an intermediate level of detail and then to hands-on tutorials. The first half is a talk and slideware. The later half is hands-on tutorials

## Recent 

* [AI NEXT 2017 conference](http://www.ainextconf.com/): On March 17, 2017, *Frank Seide* presented CNTK incl. the new functional "Layers" API. Slides are [here](./ppt/CNTK-AI-NEXT-Mar-2017-Frank-Seide-print.pdf). Video will be linked from here once available.

* Keynote at [CGO-HPCA-PPoPP-CC joint conference](http://cgo.org/cgo2017/program.html) on Feb 8, 2017 where *Frank Seide* presented CNTK with focus on the computer science behind it. Slides are [here](./ppt/CNTK-and-the-CS-behind-it-CGO-HPCA-PPoPP-CC-Keynote-Feb-2017-Frank-Seide-print.pdf). Video will be linked from here once available.

* NVidia [Inception Webinar](http://cc.readytalk.com/play?id=8kpkke) on Feb 9, 2017 where *Sayan Pathak* presented an overview of CNTK V2 with latest performance benchmarks as well as a introduction to deep learning with Cognitive Toolkit (formerly CNTK).

## Upcoming

* [WWW 2017](http://www.www2017.com.au/program/tutorials.php) - April 3-7, 2017: Half-day tutorial titled "**Scalable deep document (sequence) reasoning with Cognitive Toolkit**". Details of the tutorial can be found [here](./WWW-2017-Tutorial.md)


## Past

* [KDD 2016](http://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/): *Frank Seide and Amit Agarwal* presented a tutorial titled,  "**CNTK: Microsoft's Open-Source Deep-Learning Toolkit**" on August 16, 2016. Tutorial description [here](http://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/tutorials/view/cntk), Prerequisites page [here](./KDD-2016-Tutorial); slides [here](https://cntk.ai/kdd/CNTK-Hands-On-KDD2016-Frank-Seide-and-Amit-Agarwal.zip); video [here, note: 3 parts](http://videolectures.net/kdd2016_tutorial_deep_learning_toolkit/).
This 3-hour hands-on tutorial covers the following topics:
    * *what*: ...is CNTK? Including an introduction into the core concept of CNTK, the "computational network."
    * *how*: ...does a typical use of CNTK look like? Configuration of key components, workflow.
    * *deep dive*: ...into unique CNTK technologies. Automatic unrolling of time & efficient minibatching of variable-length sequences; data-parallel training with 1-bit SGD and Block Momentum.
    * *hands-on tutorials*:
      * *hello world*: getting set up, running a first logistic regression task
      * *language understanding*: slot and intent tagging on the ATIS language-understanding corpus. [Available online](./Hands-On-Labs-Language-Understanding)
      * *image recognition*: with convolutional nets, batch normalization,
        and residual networks using the CIFAR-10 corpus [Available online](./Hands-On-Labs-Image-Recognition.md)

* [Microsoft Research Latin American Faculty Summit 2016](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/events/latamfacsum2016/): *Frank Seide* presented, "**CNTK: Microsoft's Open-Source Deep-Learning Toolkit**," on . May 19, 2016. [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TK671HxrufE&feature=youtu.be) and <a href="./ppt/LATAM_Frank_Seide_CNTK, 2016-5-19, Print.pptx" target="_blank">Slides</a>. The 1-hour talk covers the following topics:
    * *what*: ...is CNTK? Including an introduction into the core concept of CNTK, the "computational network."
    * *how*: ...does a typical use of CNTK look like? Configuration of key components, workflow.
    * *deep dive*: ...into unique CNTK technologies. Automatic unrolling of time & efficient minibatching of variable-length sequences; data-parallel training with 1-bit SGD and Block Momentum.
    * *examples*: source code walk-through. For ResNet image classification and sequence-to-sequence modeling with attention.
