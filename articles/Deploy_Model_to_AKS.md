# Deploy a Model to Azure Container Service
The following resources from the [Cortana Intelligence and Machine Learning](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning/) team go over tutorials for deploying CNTK models to [Azure Container Service](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/container-service/).

## Deploy Pretrained Models to Azure Container Service
Tutorial: [Deployment of Pretrained Models to Azure Container Service](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/machinelearning/2017/05/25/deployment-of-pre-trained-models-on-azure-container-services/)
| [Github](https://github.com/Azure/ACS-Deployment-Tutorial)  
Authors: Mathew Salvaris, Ilia Karmanov

This end-to-end tutorial goes over the process of building a simple image classification web application, using a pretrained CNTK ResNet 152 model, and deploying the app via ACS.

Sections:
* Create Docker image of the application
* Test the application locally
* Create an ACS cluster and deploy the web app
* Test the web app
