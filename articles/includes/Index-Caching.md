Index caching allows to significantly (by a factor of 2-3x) reduce start-up times, especially when working with large input files. Setting the `cacheIndex` flag to `true` will signal the reader to write the indexing meta-data to disk (same directory as the input file) if the cache file is not available or if it is stale (older than the input file). The writing is best effort and is carried out on a separate thread in order to not affect the reader performance. If the cache file is present and is up-to-date, the reader will no longer skim the input file to build the index, instead it will load the index from the cache file. Please note that certain reader configuration parameters have a direct impact on indexing (for instance, different values of `frameMode` could potentially result in indices that have different number of sequences). For that reason, a cache file could be ignored by a reader with a configuration
different from the one that produced the cache. To see the full benefit of caching, the configuration should not be modified on subsequent reruns.
