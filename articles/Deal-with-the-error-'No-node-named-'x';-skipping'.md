This can happen for example when you use the `"write"` action for certain values of `outputputNodeNames`. The reason is that `outputNodeNames` expects the name of a node in the computational network which is not necessarily the same as the name of the expression in BrainScript. Check your log to see all the node names and use the appropriate node name as the right hand side of `outputputNodeNames`
